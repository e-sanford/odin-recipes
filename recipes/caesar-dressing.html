    <img src="../img/caesar-dressing.jpg" alt="Caesar Dressing">
    <p>Rich with egg and parmesan, with savory depth from anchovy and garlic, this Caesar dressing is delicious on any salad (not just its namesake).</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>4 oil-packed anchovy filets, or more to taste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>3/4 ounce Parmesan cheese, finely grated (23g)</li>
        <li>1/3 cup canola oil (or other neutral oil)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine egg yolk, lemon juice, anchovies, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, and Parmesan cheese in the bottom of a cup that just fits the head of an immersion blender, or in the bottom of the mini chopper attachment of a food processor. With blender or processor running, slowly drizzle in canola oil until a smooth emulsion forms. Transfer mixture to a medium bowl. </li>
        <li>Whisking constantly, slowly drizzle in 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil. Season to taste generously with salt and pepper. Caesar dressing can be stored in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>The number of anchovies and amount of Worcestershire sauce used can be varied according to taste and the size of the anchovies. For best results, use high-quality oil-packed anchovy filets.</p>
